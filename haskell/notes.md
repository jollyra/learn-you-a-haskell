"A programming languages type system deeply colours the way we think, and write code, in that language."

Haskell types are:
* strong - type strength is the permissiveness of a type system, strong type systems eliminate certain kinds of errors
* static - compiler knows the type of every value at compile time
* inferred - can automatically deduce the type of any expression

"The haskell compiler proves the absence of type errors"
